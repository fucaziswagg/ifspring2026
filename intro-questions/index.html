            <li class="answer">My name is Bean Royal, I am a senior graduating in May studying computer science</li>
        </ol>
        <li class="quesstion">Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</li>
        <ol type="a" class="embedded-list">
            <li class="answer">Like I stated before, I study computer science, and my minor is actually in human computer interaction.
                As such I like to explore design principles and practices specifically within the context of coding.
                Effective communication is something I believe is imperative and increasing important as technology continues to advance exponentially.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <li class="quesstion">Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</li>
        <ol type="a" class="embedded-list">
            <li class="answer">I have created multiple websites from scratch using the languages of html, css, JavaScript (JS), 
                the library of React JS, and the environment of Node.Js
            </li>
        </ol>
        <li class="quesstion">Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</li>
        <ol type="a" class="embedded-list">
            <li class="answer">The key thing I'm hoping to learn is how to communicate different types of information well, 
                and how different types of visual aspects change that effectiveness.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <li class="quesstion">Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</li>
        <ol type="a" class="embedded-list">
            <li class="answer">I think the key difference when it comes to designing for the screen vs paper is the use of space.
                For paper I think it's about how much information you can add into the medium before it becomes too crowded,
                while for the screen I think you want to space things and be more simplisitic in terms of quantity of content.
                Additionally, paper needs to grab the viewers attention, while the screen does that AND focuses on user interaction.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <li class="quesstion">Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective design. Explain your choice.</li>
        <ol type="a" class="embedded-list">
            <li class="answer">I think the website for the video game Grand Theft Auto 6 by rockstar games is one of the best designed sites I've personally
                ever seen (see link below). The interactivity is amazing; The "infinite scroll" feature grabs the users attention so much more 
                and allows a greater amount of information to be communicated seemlessly. 
                The only downside is that it requires a lot of performance power from your device.

            <li class="answer website-link"><a class="website-link" href="https://www.rockstargames.com/VI">GTA VI website</a></li>
        </ol>
        <li class="quesstion">Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</li>
        <ol type="a" class="embedded-list">
            <li class="answer">I think the insomnia cookies website communicates extremely well (see link below). It takes advantage of the full screen space, making
                the experience less overwhelming than those of certain other sites. The site uses a Z-style pattern that allows users to
                easily find the information they're looking for. Additionally, there's minimally text, and great topigraphical hierarchy.
            </li>
            <li class="answer website-link"><a class="website-link" href="https://insomniacookies.com/">Insomnia Cookies</a></li>
        </ol>
        <li class="quesstion">Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</li>
        <ol type="a" class="embedded-list">
            <li class="answer">One of the sites I love using and am so glad I found is the Remove.bg website (see link below). It essentially allows you to 
                quickly remove the background from any image and outputs a png file. I love this site because of how easy it is to upload an image,
                and then there's in-site features to further remove or fix the background, or add your own background, before saving the image
                with whatever quality you desire. It's super convenient, simplisitic, and easy to use.
