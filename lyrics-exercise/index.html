                <p id="about-text">“Trippy” marks the first collaboration between Anderson .Paak and J. Cole.
                    The topic of the song is love and intimacy with their respective partners.
                    This theme is touched on in the opening sample, featuring late,
                    great comedian Rodney Dangerfield.</p>
